# note.py

A simple, yet powerful and handy note taking python script. (Better than my previous note.sh)

* requires python 2.* (tested on python 2.7)

Usage:
* Download [note.py](https://github.com/sayanarijit/note.py/releases/download/1.0.0/note.py)
```
wget https://github.com/sayanarijit/note.py/releases/download/1.0.0/note.py

```
chmod +x note.py
```
* Create your 1st note (Tip: default editor is vi; to change it, edit $editor variable in note.py)
```
./note.py my first note
```
* Write "I love cheeze" and close editor. Note is created. Now lets find the note
```
